# amc-safety-equipment-detection

Code we used to create our demo for the ArcelorMittal Challenge on Intelligent Systems for plant safety.
We used OpenCV and YOLO image processing libraries to automatically detect plant workers and their safety equipment from video frames captured by surveillance cameras, and provided a prototype for an automatic warning system to alert managers/supervisors for possible safety regulation violations.
